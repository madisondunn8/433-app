-   Note: you must download “basketball.sqlite” here for the shiny app
    to work: <https://www.kaggle.com/wyattowalsh/basketball/download>,
    then put the downloaded file into your working directory within
    RStudio (dataset is too large to put on Github myself).

**For our project, we decided to investigate the relationship between
draft picks and the NBA. The data used can be seen in a shiny app,
titled “App.R”. Our full written report is also in this repository.**
